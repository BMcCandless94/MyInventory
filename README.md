# MyInventory

MyInventory is a simple inventory tracking and management web application. It was build for my capstone project when graduating with my Bachelor in Science in Computer Science - Programming. It allows a user to define a "Warehouse" and products within that warehouse. Multiple attributes can be associated with the products such as price, a name and descriptions, etc. The application can be used to track changes in volume of products. There is also a section where some useful metrics can be viewed.
